This binary runs an execv("cat /home/user/level9/.pass") after a series of conditional jumps. We will have to dissassemble it to understand what conditions must be met to reach it.

The executable compares the input with a series of keywords

Each keyword has an associated action

After each keyword has been checked for,
it displays the value of the global variable auth and service

auth ->
	auth = input + strlen("auth ")
reset ->
	free(auth) // but does not set auth to null
service ->
	service = input + strlen("service")
login ->
	if (auth[32])
		system("/bin/sh);
	else
		puts("Password:\n");

Calling auth once, and service twice, will result in the second service string
being allocated exactly 32 bytes after auth
