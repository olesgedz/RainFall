This binary runs an execv("cat /home/user/level9/.pass") after a series of conditional jumps. We will have to dissassemble it to understand what conditions must be met to reach it.

We see that the binary compares the commands received in gets() to login, auth , service and reset.

If we do auth , it will copy the str in a new memory and set the next bytes to 0.
To trigger the call to cat /home/user/level9/.pass, we want to set the buffer auth + 0x20 to something different than 0. For the test instructions to be true, we can use the command service which will do another malloc with its strdup.
So we do:

auth
service
service
login
$ cat /home/user/level9/.pass
