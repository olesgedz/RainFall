we need to change global variable m

 The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

    %[$][flags][width][.precision][length modifier]conversion

    The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion)
    with the conversion specifier.  By default, the arguments are
    used in the order given, where each '*' (see Field width and
    Precision below) and each conversion specifier asks for the next
    argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many arguments are
    given).  One can also specify explicitly which argument is taken,
    at each place where an argument is required, by writing "%m$"
    instead of '%' and "*m$" instead of '*', where the decimal
    integer m denotes the position in the argument list of the
    desired argument, indexed starting from 1.  Thus,

        printf("%*d", width, num);

    and

        printf("%2$*1$d", width, num);

    are equivalent.  The second style allows repeated references to
    the same argument.  The C99 standard does not include the style
    using '$', which comes from the Single UNIX Specification.  If
    the style using '$' is used, it must be used throughout for all
    conversions taking an argument and all width and precision
    arguments, but it may be mixed with "%%" formats, which do not
    consume an argument.  There may be no gaps in the numbers of
    arguments specified using '$'; for example, if arguments 1 and 3
    are specified, argument 2 must also be specified somewhere in the
    format string.
    
    address of M is 0x804988c
