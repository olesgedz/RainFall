No calls to /bin/sh and no direct access to .pass, we can assume we will have to use shellcode this time. operator new is called twice. This will allocate memory for an object. The program takes a single argument, that is placed into the first object instance with strlen() and memcpy(). A call later in the program uses the address stored at the start of the second object instance as parameter.

Lets try and see if we can overflow on the heap using the strcpy().

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x08048682 in main ()
The segfault occurs after 108 characters, and occurs because the program interprets the begining of the second object instance as a pointer to executable code.
To spawn a shell we will have to include pointers that redirect to our shellcode so that the instructions before the call do not crash.


Getting the pointer to buffer esp+0x10, because of getting the value 0x804a00x + 4 = 0x804a010
